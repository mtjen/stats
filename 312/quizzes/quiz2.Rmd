## Problem 1: 

The time until recharge for a battery in a laptop computer under common conditions is normally distributed with a mean of 260 minutes and a standard deviation of 50 minutes.  

### a)
What is the probability that a battery lasts more than four hours? (2 points)  
```{r}
prob = pnorm(240, 260, 50)
1 - prob
```
Ans: P(4 hours or 240 minutes) = 0.655

### b)
What are the quartiles (the 25% and 75% values) of battery life? (4 points)  

```{r}
qnorm(.25, 260, 50)
qnorm(.75, 260, 50)
```
Ans:  
25% = 226.3 minutes or 3.77 hours  
75% = 293.7 minutes or 4.90 hours
